# MERN stack netflix

This project is a copy of netflix. I built it watching the application mobile (for mobile resolution of course) and the official page.

Obiously this app isn't complete because netflix is very big. Principally i wanted create the main page (the list of movies, categories, main-image, header, etc) but after i created the register and login page.

The pages have responsive web design. i wanted to have everything better organized but it still costs me.

Technologies used:

- React
- Node
- Express
- MongoDB Atlas
